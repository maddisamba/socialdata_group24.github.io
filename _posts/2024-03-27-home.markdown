This site will delve into San Francisco, concentrating on crime data from 2003 to 2017. We'll narrow our exploration to prostitution in the city to gain a clearer view of crime in San Francisco and uncover some insights in patterns or other observations that could be relevant or interesting. For our analysis we will provide three different types of visualizations. The first one is a time series of prostituion crimes along the years by district, the second is a map displaying the occurences of prostituion and other focus crimes by district for comparinson and the third is a interactive analysis of the crime data per hour per district.

                    <h2>Crime Trends Over Time</h2>
                    <p>
Our journey begins with a comprehensive time-series analysis, charting the ebb and flow of various crime categories from 2010 to 2020. The visualization presents a clear narrative of the city's battle with crime, highlighting significant trends such as the gradual decrease in property crimes like burglary and larceny, juxtaposed against a concerning rise in cyber-related offenses, reflecting the city's tech-centric identity.

This graph not only serves as a testament to the evolving nature of crime in response to societal and technological advancements but also sheds light on the effectiveness of law enforcement strategies and community initiatives aimed at curbing these incidents. For instance, the sharp decline in vehicle thefts post-2015 could be attributed to enhanced security measures and increased public awareness campaigns.

                    <h2>Mapping Crime Hotspots</h2>
                    <p>Our second visualization delves into the geographical dimension of crime in San Francisco, focusing on identifying crime hotspots across the city's neighborhoods over the years. While our primary focus was on understanding the prevalence of prostitution, we also included other types of crimes to uncover potential correlations with prostitution occurrences in areas with high crime rates. It's important to note that the data analyzed extends until May 2018, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of crime distribution within the city.<br><br>Upon closer examination, it becomes evident that the majority of prostitution-related crimes are concentrated in the Mission district, with a significant number also occurring in the Northern district. Interestingly, similar patterns emerge when analyzing other types of crimes, particularly Disorderly Conduct and Driving Under the Influence, suggesting possible interconnectedness between these offenses.</p>

                    <br><p>The maps we've generated reveal a dynamic landscape where crime concentrations evolve in response to various factors such as urban development, shifts in socio-economic status, and the implementation of targeted policing strategies.<br><br>Notably, areas like the Tenderloin and Mission districts consistently emerge as high-crime zones, while neighborhoods such as Sunset and Richmond exhibit relatively lower crime rates, underscoring disparities in safety and quality of life within the city.<br><br>This spatial analysis not only aids law enforcement in resource allocation and strategic planning but also empowers residents with valuable insights into safety and security, fostering a more informed and vigilant community.

                    <h2>Dive Deeper with Interactive Data</h2>
                    
                    <p>The final visualization on this site is an interactive plot of the distribution of prostitution pr. hour for each police district. This plot makes it possible to compare the districts and the occurance of prostitution crime in the different districts. This can be overwhelming to look at all districts at the same time, which is why it make sense to have an interactive filter, that makes it possible to only compare a few districts at a time.</p>

<iframe src="https://maddisamba.github.io/socialdata_group24.github.io/prostitution_incidents_by_district.html" frameborder="0" width="120%" height="450">                     </iframe>

<p>Multiple insights for each district can be made based on this plot, both by looking at one district and comparing them. One big insight that can be made is the contrast between Richmond and Tenderloin, where the crime rate is higher in middle of the day for Richmond, while Tenderloin has the highest crime rate at night. There seems to be a big difference between the 2 districts, which could be of a possible reasons include the behaviour of the police in each district, but it's some insight that maybe could help the 2 districts to plan how they will allocate their ressources related to prostitution crime.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The analysis of San Francisco's crime data from 2010 to 2020 paints a complex picture of a city in flux, wrestling with the dual forces of innovation and inequality. While certain types of crime have seen a decline thanks to concerted efforts by the community and law enforcement, others have emerged or persisted, adapting to the changing urban landscape.

The shifting hotspots of crime across the city underscore the need for a dynamic and responsive approach to public safety, one that harnesses technology, data, and community engagement in equal measure. As San Francisco continues to evolve, so too must our strategies for safeguarding its residents and ensuring that the city remains a beacon of culture, innovation, and inclusivity on the West Coast.

By leveraging data-driven insights such as those presented in our visualizations, we can begin to untangle the complex web of factors influencing crime trends and work towards a safer, more secure San Francisco for all.
